The data was not collected this way; so, an assumption had to be made to randomly group data entries to perform an A/B test. This dataset does not account for other likely explanations. For example, riders might not carry lots of cash, so it's easier to pay for longer/farther trips with a credit card. In other words, it's far more likely that fare amount determines payment type, rather than vice versa. "
